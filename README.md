# DOMStep: A Browser Dance Party

Slides from my StrangeLoop 2014 talk about the Web Audio API.

## Setup And Running



```bash
# install modules
npm install
npm install -g gulp
# build js
gulp build && gulp watch
# start the server
node index.js
```


## Insiration

I have learned from and/or been influenced by too many people to mention here.

Stuart Memo ([@stuartmemo](http://twitter.com/stuartmemo)) was the first person
I saw do anything with the Web Audio API. See [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN8Eg1K9xjE&feature=youtu.be)
for an overview of playing with the API, and a big inspiration for my talk.

[@jsantell](http://twitter.com/jsantell) works on the Firefox Web Audio API
devtools and makes sweet beats.

many more.
